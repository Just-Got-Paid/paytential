### üöÄ Problem Statement

Those who are first-generation, low-income, and/or BIPOC face the unique challenges of attaining financial literacy, which is essential for their personal and professional success. These individuals often lack the critical financial education and resources that provide a financial foundation for budgeting, saving, investing, and credit management. Along with systemic inequities in education, limited financial conversations in the household exacerbate this knowledge gap as opposed to those in agent groups who have been systematically advantaged by society and have the privilege of passing wealth and financial knowledge. As a result, the cycle of poverty persists as individuals need financial literacy to be able to make informed financial decisions that promote long-term economic mobility and build generational wealth.

### ‚òÄ Summary

#### According to the FINRA Foundation's 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) report:

- The 2018 NFCS includes two new questions to measure financial anxiety and stress. As the accompanying charts illustrate, many Americans find their personal finances a source of anxiety or stress. Over half (53%) agree that thinking about their personal finances makes them anxious (5 to 7 on a 7-point scale), and 44% agree that discussing their finances is stressful.

- **Fewer Than Half Have Emergency Funds**: In the 2018 NFCS, nearly half (49%) of respondents report having emergency funds. However, almost half (46%) have not set aside funds sufficient to cover expenses for three months in case of sickness, job loss, economic downturn, or other emergency.

- **Costly Credit Card Practices**: Considering the subset of behaviors that are likely to generate sizeable interest or fees (paying the minimum due, paying late fees, paying over-the-limit fees, or using the card for cash advances), we find that 42% of credit card holders engage in at least one of these expensive practices, up slightly from 39% in 2015. Looking across age cohorts, income levels, and ethnicity, younger respondents, those with lower incomes, and African-American respondents are more likely to use costly credit card borrowing methods.

- Among those with student loans for themselves, nearly half (47%) say they wish they had gone to a less expensive college, compared to only 9% among those without loans for themselves.

#### According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018:

- The gap in financial literacy performance between top and bottom performers in the U.S. is significant, with a score difference of 266 points between the 90th and 10th percentiles. This gap is larger than the average score gap of 242 points observed across OECD countries. The U.S. gap exceeds that of 13 education systems and is not measurably different from 6 others. Internationally, score gaps range from 205 points in Latvia to 275 points in Australia.

#### The significant gap in financial literacy performance between top and bottom performers in the U.S. leads to several social problems:

- **Economic Inequality**: A lack of financial literacy can perpetuate cycles of poverty, as individuals with lower financial knowledge may struggle to manage their finances, invest wisely, or save for the future.

- **Increased Debt**: Individuals with lower financial literacy are more likely to incur high levels of debt, particularly from credit cards and loans, leading to financial stress and long-term financial instability.

- **Poor Decision-Making**: Without the skills to make informed financial decisions, individuals may fall victim to predatory lending practices, scams, or mismanagement of resources.

- **Limited Access to Opportunities**: Financial illiteracy can hinder access to opportunities like homeownership, higher education, or investment in personal development, further entrenching social and economic disparities.

- **Lower Economic Mobility**: The gap in financial literacy contributes to lower economic mobility, as individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds may lack the knowledge and resources to improve their financial situation.

Overall, this gap can exacerbate existing inequalities and hinder efforts to create a more equitable society.

#### Addressing Racial Wealth Gaps through Financial Literacy

‚ÄúDecreasing racial wealth gaps will take time, but a key factor is ensuring communities of color have access to financial literacy classes.‚Äù - NEA

##### Developing Interactive Educational Tools

Developing interactive educational tools like the Student Budget Simulation Game can empower individuals with practical budgeting skills, helping to bridge the financial literacy gap.

##### Enhancing Accessibility to Financial Education

Creating platforms that are engaging and easy to navigate can make financial literacy more attainable for underserved communities. This approach will hopefully promote interest among users, encouraging them to become more invested in their personal finances and to further investigate financial topics.

##### Fostering Real-World Applications

The Student Budget Simulation Game provides an interactive experience that allows users to practice budgeting in a safe environment, preparing them for real-life financial decisions. Gamification hopefully allows users to engage with the topic without feeling overwhelmed, making financial concepts more approachable and less intimidating.

##### Encouraging Community Engagement

By promoting the use of such tools, communities can share knowledge and resources, ultimately strengthening their financial capabilities and reducing wealth disparities. This environment can also foster more open discussions about financial issues, helping to reduce stress and stigma associated with money management.

### üòä Hypothesis

If first-generation, low-income BIPOC can participate in the interactive simulation that teaches them about receiving paychecks and managing money, they will gain financial literacy skills that will lead to increased confidence in financial decision-making and improve their budgeting and money management skills in real-life scenarios. By providing effective financial education through the simulation, we can break the cycle of poverty and address the gap created by the lack of financial literacy, ultimately empowering individuals to make informed financial choices. This empowerment will foster greater economic mobility, enhance their ability to build generational wealth and contribute to the overall economic stability of their communities.
