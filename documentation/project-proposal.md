### üöÄ Problem Statement

Those who are first-generation, low-income and/or BIPOC face the unique challenges of attaining financial literacy, which is essential for their personal and professional success. These individuals often lack the critical financial education and resources that provides a financial foundation of budgeting, saving, investing, and credit management. Along with systemic inequities in education, limited financial conversations in the household exacerbate this knowledge gap opposed to those in agent groups who has been systematically advantaged by society and have the privilege of passing wealth and financial knowledge. As a result, the cycle of poverty persists as without financial literacy, individuals are not able to make informed financial decisions that promotes long-term economic mobility and building generational wealth.
